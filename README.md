# Anarchist Bot
Discord doesn't provide any functionnality to create a server based on a **horizontal hierarchy**.
By that, this bot aims at giving this opportunity to whoever wants to build such server. The **temporary admin** configure the bot and **throw their permission** to let people vote and organized the server.

# How To Install

# How To Configure
As the bot can be used for many reasons, there is a configurable file in which all available settings are noted. You can edit them in many ways.
## By command on Discord
If you're an admin, type the `<prefix>config` command.
You'll get all the details needed to modify the config and all its settings.
## By editing the server file
Go to the Bot folder, then follow the tree structure as follows:
```
handler / configs / <your server ID> / config.json
```
Most of the settings are booleans, but some need channel-names (or channel-ids): be aware !
## Config Variables
```
